  <Description>Zeta is an Infinite Heaven module that is both a modding framework and an in-game mod manager. It can manage weapons, vehicles, custom player models, buddies and more. It's required to use Zeta modules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mod Manager: Configure all of your mods in-game! You can toggle them, change their settings as well as their load order to resolve file conflicts.
•  Modding Framework: Using several new LUA functions, you can easily make the modifications you want without overwriting game files.
• Backwards Compatibility: Non-IH mods can be loaded by Zeta and used alongside other mods.
• Included Mods: Advanced Graphics Menu, Unlocked Weapon Customization, Zeta Editor
